Woketo
======

A PHP WebSocket library. With following features:

* **Server**
* **Client**
* WSS Support (WebSocket over **SSL**)
* Autobahn test suite passed (WebSocket test suite reference)
* Binary/text messages supported
* Built on top of reactphp (async socket communication)
* *Not dependent of any other big framework/library which mean you can use it with guzzle (any version) or Symfony (any version)*

Requirements
------------

* PHP 7+

How to install
--------------

```bash
# The installation is pretty much easier with composer. But you still can use it as git submodule !
composer require "nekland/woketo"
```

And that's all ! :scream_cat: 

How to use it
-------------

The file `tests.php` is a basic echo server. That's all you need to make a websocket server with Woketo:


```php
<?php

use Your\Namespace\YourMessageHandler;
use Nekland\Woketo\Server\WebSocketServer;

$server = new WebSocketServer(1337);
$server->setMessageHandler(new YourMessageHandler(), '/path'); // accessible on ws://127.0.0.1:1337/path
$server->start(); // And that's all <3
```

```php
<?php
// YourMessageHandler.php

namespace Your\Namespace;

use Nekland\Woketo\Core\AbstractConnection;
use Nekland\Woketo\Message\TextMessageHandler;

class YourMessageHandler extends TextMessageHandler
{
    public function onConnection(AbstractConnection $connection)
    {
        // Doing something when the client is connected ?
        // This method is totally optional.
    }
    
    public function onMessage(string $data, AbstractConnection $connection)
    {
        // Sending back the received data
        $connection->write($data);
    }
    
    public function onDisconnect(AbstractConnection $connection)
    {
        // Doing something when the connection between client/server is disconnecting
        // Optionnal
    }
}
```

How to test
-----------

### Unit tests suite

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Nekland/Woketo
cd Woketo
composer install
./bin/phpunit
```


### Functionnal tests suite

#### Server test suite

```bash
php tests/echo-server.php
wstest -m fuzzingclient
```

#### Client test suite

```bash
wstest -m fuzzingserver
php tests/client_autobahn.php
```

> wstest is the Autobahn test tool. You can install it with `sudo pip install autobahntestsuite`.
>
> You can read more about the installation of Autobahn on
> [their documentation](http://autobahn.ws/testsuite/installation.html#installation).

What's next?
-------------

You can see what's planned for next versions in the [github milestones](https://github.com/Nekland/Woketo/milestones).

What Woketo does _not_ do?
---------------------------

Currently there is no support of the following:

- WebSocket extensions, currently not supported but will probably be in the future
- [WAMP](http://wamp-proto.org/) implementation will probably never be done by Woketo itself as it's a layer on top of
  WebSockets. This includes JSON-RPC and other layers up to WebSockets.
- Woketo have no HTTP server layer and is not compatible with [PHP PM](https://github.com/php-pm/php-pm). This is planned for next releases (probably the v3).
